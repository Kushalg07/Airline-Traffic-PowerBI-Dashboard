# 📊 Airline Traffic & Performance Insights

This document summarizes key analytical insights derived from the Power BI dashboard.

---

## 🛫 Overall Performance Summary

- Majority of flights are On-Time (61.67%).
- A significant portion (35.9%) of flights experience delays.
- Flight cancellations are relatively low at 2.43%.
- Total recorded delay time across airlines is 1.22 million minutes.

This indicates operational stability but highlights delay management as a critical improvement area.

---

## 📅 Performance by Day of Week

- Tuesday shows the highest on-time flights (~45K).
- Monday and Wednesday also show high operational activity.
- Saturday has comparatively lower total flights.
- Delays are distributed consistently across weekdays.

This suggests weekday-heavy operations with peak activity midweek.

---

## 🏢 Airline-Level Delay Analysis

- Delta Air Lines and United Air Lines show high total delay volumes.
- American Airlines also records substantial delay minutes.
- Mesa Airlines shows comparatively lower delay values.

This may indicate:

- Higher traffic load for major airlines.
- Operational congestion.
- Possible scheduling inefficiencies.

---

## 📈 Year-wise Flight Trend

- 2009 and 2010 show strong flight volumes (~0.23M each).
- 2011 shows a decrease (~0.02M).
- Total aggregated flights: 0.47M.

Possible reasons:

- Operational scaling
- Market changes
- Data coverage variation

---

## ⏰ Departure Hour Traffic Pattern

- Peak flight hours are between 9 AM – 6 PM.
- Midday (around 12 PM and 3 PM) shows highest traffic (~51K).
- Very early morning (3 AM) has minimal flights (~2K).

This indicates:

- Strong daytime traffic concentration.
- Clear peak scheduling windows.
- Potential congestion during business hours.

---

## 🛬 Airport-Level Traffic Distribution

- BWI handles the highest traffic (~206K, 43.6%).
- DCA accounts for ~145K (30.6%).
- IAD accounts for ~122K (25.8%).

This suggests BWI is the dominant origin airport in this dataset.

---

## 📌 Business Recommendations

Based on insights:

1. Focus on reducing weekday delays (especially high-volume airlines).
2. Optimize peak-hour scheduling.
3. Improve resource allocation at BWI airport.
4. Analyze delay causes for major carriers (Delta, United, American).
5. Consider predictive delay modeling for proactive management.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Implement Delay Prediction Model using Machine Learning
- Forecast traffic trends using time-series models
- Airline performance clustering
- Root-cause analysis for delays

---

## 📊 Conclusion

The dashboard successfully provides a 360-degree view of airline operational performance.  

While on-time performance is strong, delay management and peak-hour congestion remain key areas for improvement.
